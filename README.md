Two Degree of Freedom Hamiltonian Systems in Chemical Reaction Dynamics â€“ A Phase Space Analysis

In this project we further the investigation into the phase space analysis of two degree of freedom Hamiltonian systems in the field of chemical reaction dynamics. We start by studying, the De Leon Berne system, a benchmark system that has been well studied over the past half century, with the goal of gaining an understanding of the reaction phenomena that can be applied to more complicated systems. We then move onto one of these more complex systems: the Gezelter-Miller three-well potential.
In [1], the topic of normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds, or NHIMs, and dividing surfaces is explained, and it is these concepts that will be the basis for gaining an understanding of these potentials.
